ETL Telecom Case Study, Using SSIS, in this project I used a dataset related to the field of communication (such as IMSI / IMEI / TAC / SNR).

Steps I followed:

1- Read, process and transfer data. 

2- Dealing with data that do not meet the quality requirements.

3- Nulls, Missing Values and error handling.

4- Handle files stored in a specific folder "looping through files".

5- Archive files that are processed in another folder.

6- Auditing of processed data.
